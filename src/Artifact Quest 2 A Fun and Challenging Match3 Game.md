## Swap, Group, Chain, and Collapse Modes
 
Artifact Quest 2 offers four different modes of matching tiles. Each mode has its own rules and challenges that will test your skills and strategy.
 
In swap mode, you have to swap adjacent tiles to make matches of three or more of the same color. This is the classic and most common mode in match-3 games.
 
In group mode, you have to click on groups of three or more tiles of the same color to remove them from the board. You can also drag your mouse over the tiles to select larger groups.
 
In chain mode, you have to create chains of tiles of the same color by clicking on them in sequence. The longer the chain, the more points you get.
 
In collapse mode, you have to click on tiles of the same color that are touching each other horizontally or vertically. The tiles will collapse and new ones will fall from above.
 
## Power-ups and Boosters
 
Artifact Quest 2 also features a variety of power-ups and boosters that will help you complete the levels faster and easier. You can earn power-ups by making matches of four or more tiles, or by filling up a meter at the bottom of the screen.
 
Some of the power-ups you can use are:

- Bomb: Destroys a 3x3 area of tiles around it.
- Lightning: Destroys all the tiles of one color on the board.
- Hammer: Destroys any tile you click on.
- Shuffle: Shuffles all the tiles on the board.
- Color Splash: Changes the color of all the tiles in a row or column.

You can also buy boosters with coins that you earn by playing the game. Some of the boosters you can buy are:

- Extra Moves: Gives you five more moves to finish the level.
- Extra Time: Gives you 30 more seconds to finish the level.
- Magnet: Attracts all the tiles of one color to it.
- Rainbow: Acts as a wild card and can match with any color.
- Freeze: Freezes the timer for 10 seconds.

## Museum and Mini-Game
 
Another feature that makes Artifact Quest 2 stand out is the museum that you can decorate and customize with the artifacts you find. Each artifact belongs to a different collection, such as Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Aztec, etc. You can place them on pedestals, shelves, or walls, and change their orientation and size. You can also change the background and floor of the museum to suit your taste.
 
The museum is not only for show; it also serves as a way to unlock a mini-game that lets you create your own artifacts. To play this mini-game, you have to click on an empty pedestal and choose a collection. Then, you have to solve a puzzle that involves rotating and placing pieces of an artifact until they form a complete image. The puzzles vary in difficulty and complexity depending on the collection. Once you solve a puzzle, you can name your artifact and place it in your museum.
