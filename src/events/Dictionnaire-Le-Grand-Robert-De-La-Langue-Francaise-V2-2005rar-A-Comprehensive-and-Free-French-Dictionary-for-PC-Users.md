## Why Use a French Dictionary?
  
A French dictionary is not only useful for translating words from French to English or vice versa, but also for improving your French skills in various ways. Here are some of the benefits of using a French dictionary:
  
- You can learn the correct pronunciation of a word by looking at its phonetic transcription or listening to its audio recording (if available).
- You can find out the gender of a French noun by looking for the symbols m (masculine), f (feminine), or pl (plural) next to it, or by checking if it has le, la, or les before it.
- You can choose the right adjective to match the noun by looking for the masculine and feminine forms of the adjective, and making sure they agree in gender and number.
- You can conjugate verbs correctly by finding the infinitive form of the verb and then looking at the verb tables that show you how to use it in different tenses and moods.
- You can enrich your vocabulary by discovering synonyms, antonyms, idioms, and expressions related to a word.
- You can explore the culture and literature of the French-speaking world by reading the quotations from various sources that illustrate the usage of a word.

## How to Choose a French Dictionary?
  
There are many types of French dictionaries available online and offline, but not all of them are equally reliable and comprehensive. Here are some criteria to consider when choosing a French dictionary:

- The scope: Some dictionaries are specialized in certain fields or domains, such as business, medicine, or slang. Others are general-purpose and cover a wide range of topics and registers. Depending on your needs and interests, you may want to choose a dictionary that suits your level and purpose.
- The size: Some dictionaries are more concise and compact, while others are more extensive and detailed. The size of a dictionary affects its portability and accessibility, as well as its coverage and depth. You may want to have both a small dictionary for quick reference and a large dictionary for thorough research.
- The quality: Some dictionaries are more accurate and authoritative than others, depending on their sources, methods, and editors. You may want to check the reputation and reviews of a dictionary before using it. You may also want to compare different dictionaries to see how they handle the same word or phrase.
- The features: Some dictionaries offer more features and functions than others, such as audio pronunciations, examples sentences, illustrations, cross-references, appendices, etc. You may want to choose a dictionary that provides you with the most information and convenience possible.
